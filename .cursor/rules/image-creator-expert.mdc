## Image Generation Workflow

### Proven 5-Step Process (Based on Successful nano-banana Implementation)

1. **Analyze Requirements**: Understand the context, purpose, and specifications
    - Identify image type (hero, product, team, etc.)
    - Determine technical specs (size, format, aspect ratio)
    - Consider brand guidelines and design system

2. **Select Model**: Choose the most appropriate model based on use case
    - **Default**: nano-banana for general professional images
    - **Alternative**: FLUX.1 for speed, Seedream for photorealism
    - Check model schema: `fal-get-model-schema`

3. **Craft Prompts**: Create detailed, specific prompts for optimal results
    - Include subject, style, composition, lighting, technical specs
    - Specify aspect ratio (3:2 for hero sections)
    - Add quality and mood descriptors

4. **Generate & Monitor**: Execute the proven generation workflow
    - Enqueue: `fal-enqueue` with optimized parameters
    - Monitor: `fal-get-status` until completion
    - Retrieve: `fal-get-result` to get image URL

5. **Download & Optimize**: Save and prepare for web use
    - Download directly: `curl -o /path/to/image.jpg "image-url"`
    - Verify file size and format
    - Ensure proper naming and organization

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### Structure Your Prompts:

```
[Subject], [Style/Artistic Direction], [Composition/Layout], [Lighting/Mood], [Technical Details], [Quality Specifications]
```

### Examples:

- **Hero Section**: "Modern SaaS dashboard interface, clean minimal design, professional lighting, high resolution, 16:9 aspect ratio, web-ready"
- **Product Shot**: "Premium wireless headphones, studio lighting, white background, 1000x1000px, commercial photography style"
- **Team Photo**: "Diverse group of professionals collaborating, modern office setting, natural lighting, warm and approachable, high resolution"

## Technical Specifications

### Common Image Formats:

- **PNG**: For images with transparency, logos, icons
- **JPEG/WebP**: For photographs, hero images, optimized file sizes
- **SVG**: For simple graphics, logos (when possible)

### Standard Web Sizes:

- **Hero Images**: 1920x1080px, 1600x900px
- **Card Images**: 400x300px, 600x400px
- **Thumbnails**: 300x200px, 400x267px
- **Icons**: 24x24px, 48x48px, 96x96px

### Performance Optimization:

- Use WebP format when possible
- Implement lazy loading
- Optimize file sizes (< 500KB for hero images)
- Use responsive images with srcset

## Integration with Web Projects

### Next.js/React Integration:

- Store images in `/public/images/` or use cloud storage
- Use Next.js Image component for optimization
- Implement proper alt texts for accessibility
- Generate responsive image variants

### Content Management:

- Create consistent naming conventions
- Organize images by type/component
- Maintain image libraries for reuse
- Document image usage and context

## Quality Assurance

### Image Quality Checklist:

- [ ] Resolution appropriate for intended use
- [ ] Colors match brand guidelines
- [ ] Composition is balanced and professional
- [ ] Text (if any) is legible and properly sized
- [ ] File size optimized for web performance
- [ ] Format appropriate for use case

### Accessibility Considerations:

- Always provide meaningful alt text
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Consider color blindness in design choices
- Test images load properly on various devices

## MCP Tool Usage

### Proven Tool Sequence (Tested with nano-banana)

1. **fal-get-model-schema**: Always check model parameters first

    ```
    modelId: "fal-ai/nano-banana"
    ```

2. **fal-enqueue**: Queue generation request (recommended for reliability)

    ```json
    {
        "modelId": "fal-ai/nano-banana",
        "input": {
            "prompt": "detailed prompt here",
            "aspect_ratio": "3:2",
            "output_format": "jpeg",
            "num_images": 1
        }
    }
    ```

3. **fal-get-status**: Monitor generation progress

    ```
    modelId: "fal-ai/nano-banana"
    requestId: "returned-from-enqueue"
    ```

4. **fal-get-result**: Retrieve completed image

    ```
    modelId: "fal-ai/nano-banana"
    requestId: "same-request-id"
    ```

5. **Download**: Use curl or direct download
    ```bash
    curl -o /path/to/image.jpg "image-url-from-result"
    ```

### Alternative Tools

- **fal-run-sync**: For simple, fast requests (< 10 seconds expected)
- **fal-list-models**: Discover available models
- **fal-search-models**: Find specific model types by keyword

## Common Use Cases

### Website Assets:

- Hero section backgrounds
- Feature illustrations
- Team member photos (stock/alternative)
- Product mockups
- Testimonial avatars
- Blog post images

### App Interfaces:

- Onboarding illustrations
- Empty state graphics
- Loading animations (static frames)
- Icon sets
- UI component mockups

### Marketing Materials:

- Social media graphics
- Email newsletter images
- Presentation slides
- Banner advertisements

## Best Practices

### Prompt Optimization:

- Be specific about style, composition, and technical requirements
- Use reference artists/styles when applicable
- Specify aspect ratios and resolutions
- Include lighting and mood descriptions
- Mention quality and detail level expectations

### Performance First:

- Always optimize images for web delivery
- Use modern formats (WebP, AVIF)
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Consider CDN delivery for global audiences

### Consistency:

- Maintain consistent style across related images
- Use brand colors and visual guidelines
- Create image style guides for teams
- Document generation parameters for reproducibility

## Error Handling

### Common Issues:

- **Model Limitations**: Some models have restrictions on content types
- **Rate Limiting**: Respect API limits and implement retry logic
- **Generation Failures**: Have fallback options and alternative prompts
- **Quality Issues**: Iterate on prompts rather than accepting poor results

### Recovery Strategies:

- Try alternative models for failed generations
- Simplify prompts if generation fails
- Use different aspect ratios or resolutions
- Implement caching to avoid repeated failures
