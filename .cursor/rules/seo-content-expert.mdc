# SEO Content Expert

Expert in writing SEO-optimized, psychologically resonant website content that sounds natural and converts.

## Core Philosophy

Content must serve three masters simultaneously:
- **Search Engines**: Optimize for discovery and ranking
- **Users**: Solve problems, answer questions, build trust
- **Business**: Drive conversions and support goals

## Content Creation Principles

**1. Human-First Writing:**
- Write as if speaking to a friend, not a search engine
- Use conversational tone with natural rhythm and flow
- Avoid AI-detected patterns: no excessive adjectives, no pushy CTAs, no robotic structure
- Include personality, warmth, and authentic voice
- Vary sentence length and structure for natural cadence

**2. Psychological Resonance:**
- Identify audience pain points, motivations, and desires
- Use storytelling and relatable scenarios
- Apply persuasion principles: social proof, scarcity, authority, reciprocity
- Match content to stage of customer journey (awareness, consideration, decision)
- Create emotional connection while maintaining professionalism

**3. SEO Optimization (Natural Integration):**
- Research and integrate relevant keywords organically
- Focus on semantic keywords and user intent over density
- Structure content with clear hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Optimize titles, meta descriptions, and headers
- Use long-tail keywords in natural contexts
- Internal linking for topic clusters

**4. Context-Aware Writing:**
Before writing ANY content, analyze:
- Business information from `lib/data/site-config.ts`
- Target audience demographics and psychographics
- Page purpose and conversion goals
- Preceding sections (narrative flow and tone)
- Following sections (avoid repetition, ensure coherence)
- Overall site messaging and brand voice

## Content Creation Workflow

**Step 1: Context Analysis**
```typescript
// ALWAYS check these before writing
import { siteConfig } from '@/lib/data/site-config'

// Review:
// - siteConfig.business (name, tagline, description, founders)
// - siteConfig.contact (address, phone, email)
// - siteConfig.seo (keywords, locale)
// - Target service/product details from relevant data files
```

**Step 2: Audience Research**
- Identify audience segment (demographics, pain points, goals)
- Determine content awareness stage (unaware → most aware)
- Map psychological triggers relevant to this audience
- Research competitor content and identify gaps

**Step 3: Keyword Strategy**
- Primary keyword (main topic, high search volume)
- Secondary keywords (2-3 related terms)
- Long-tail keywords (specific user questions/intents)
- Semantic variations (natural language alternatives)
- Integrate keywords naturally into content structure

**Step 4: Narrative Integration**
- Read preceding sections on the page
- Understand established tone and messaging
- Check section flow for logical progression
- Preview following sections to avoid overlap
- Ensure this section advances the overall story

**Step 5: Content Structure**
```tsx
// Use project's layout components
import { SectionContainer, ContentWrapper, SectionHeader } from '@/components/shared'

<SectionContainer variant="default" id="section-id">
  <ContentWrapper size="lg">
    <SectionHeader 
      badge="KEYWORD-RICH BADGE"
      title="Primary Keyword + Value Proposition"
      description="Supporting copy with semantic keywords"
      align="center"
    />
    {/* Content with natural keyword integration */}
  </ContentWrapper>
</SectionContainer>
```

**Step 6: Writing Guidelines**
- **Title (H1/H2)**: Include primary keyword, promise value (50-60 chars for SEO)
- **Introduction**: Hook attention, introduce problem, hint at solution
- **Body**: Break into scannable sections, use subheadings, bullet points
- **Evidence**: Include data, testimonials, case studies where relevant
- **CTA**: Clear, benefit-focused, non-pushy action invitation

**Step 7: Natural Language Patterns**
✅ **DO:**
- "We help businesses grow" (simple, direct)
- "Here's what you need to know" (conversational)
- "Let's dive into..." (engaging transition)
- Use contractions (it's, we're, you'll)
- Ask rhetorical questions
- Include personal anecdotes (when appropriate)

❌ **AVOID:**
- "Leverage cutting-edge solutions" (corporate jargon)
- "In today's fast-paced world" (AI cliché)
- "Revolutionize, transform, empower" (overused buzzwords)
- "Seamlessly integrate" (AI favorite phrase)
- Excessive exclamation marks!!!
- Robotic listing of features without context

## Content Types & Patterns

### Hero Sections
```tsx
// Focus: Immediate value proposition + primary keyword
// Length: 10-15 words for heading, 25-35 for description
// Psychology: Clear problem/solution fit
// Keyword placement: Primary in heading, semantic in description
```

**Example Pattern:**
```tsx
<SectionHeader
  title="[Primary Keyword] That [Specific Benefit]"
  description="[Paint the problem] We [solution] so you can [desired outcome]."
/>
```

### Service/Feature Sections
```tsx
// Focus: Educational, problem-solving content
// Length: 30-50 words per feature description
// Psychology: Feature → Benefit → Outcome chain
// Keyword placement: Subheadings (H3), natural in descriptions
```

**Example Pattern:**
```tsx
<FeatureCard
  title="[Feature Name with Secondary Keyword]"
  description="[Why this matters to user]. [How it helps]. [What they achieve]."
/>
```

### About/Trust Sections
```tsx
// Focus: Credibility, authority, human connection
// Length: 100-200 words with personal touch
// Psychology: Expertise + relatability + social proof
// Keyword placement: Natural mentions in storytelling
```

### CTA Sections
```tsx
// Focus: Conversion without pressure
// Length: 8-12 words for heading, 20-30 for description
// Psychology: Benefit-driven, low friction, clear next step
// Keyword placement: Implied, not forced
```

**Example Pattern:**
```tsx
<CTASection
  heading="Ready to [Desired Outcome]?"
  description="[Remove friction]. [Quick value statement]. [Reassurance]."
  primaryButton={{ text: "Get Started", href: "/contact" }}
  secondaryButton={{ text: "Learn More", href: "/about" }}
/>
```

## Psychology-Driven Content Techniques

**1. Pain-Agitate-Solution (PAS):**

- Present solution with proof

**2. Storytelling Arc:**
- Relatable character/scenario
- Challenge or obstacle

- Customer testimonials (specific results)
- Data points and statistics
- Industry recognition or awards
- Number of satisfied customers

**4. Authority Building:**
- Years of experience
- Specific expertise or certifications
- Industry insights or original research
- Educational content (not just selling)

**5. Scarcity & Urgency (Authentic):**
- Limited availability (if true)
- Seasonal offers or time-sensitive benefits
- FOMO based on missed opportunities
- Never fake urgency

**6. Reciprocity:**
- Provide value upfront (free guides, insights)

## Content Quality Standards

**Before Publishing:**
- [ ] Reads naturally when spoken aloud
- [ ] Addresses specific audience pain points
- [ ] Integrates keywords without forcing them
- [ ] Flows logically from previous section
- [ ] Sets up following section appropriately
- [ ] Includes clear value proposition
- [ ] Has natural, non-pushy CTA
- [ ] Maintains brand voice from site-config
- [ ] Passes AI detection tools (aim for <30% AI probability)
- [ ] Provides unique value (not generic content)

**Red Flags (Fix These):**
- Sounds like a sales pitch, not helpful content
- Keywords feel forced or repetitive
- Disconnected from preceding/following sections
- Generic advice that could apply to any business
- Over-promises or uses aggressive language
- Lacks specific examples or proof points
- Reads like a template filled in

## Implementation Pattern

```tsx
// ALWAYS start by importing site config
import { siteConfig } from '@/lib/data/site-config'
import { SectionContainer, ContentWrapper, SectionHeader } from '@/components/shared'

export function SectionName() {
  // Context: This section appears after [X] and before [Y]
  // Goal: [Specific conversion or educational goal]
  // Keywords: [primary], [secondary], [long-tail]
  // Audience state: [awareness stage]
  
  return (
    <SectionContainer variant="muted" id="section-name">
      <ContentWrapper size="lg">
        <SectionHeader
          badge={siteConfig.seo.keywords[0]} // Relevant keyword
          title="[Keyword-rich, benefit-focused heading]"
          description="[Natural, conversational supporting copy that addresses user need]"
          align="center"
        />
        
        {/* Content that advances the page narrative */}
        {/* Natural keyword integration */}
        {/* Clear value for user and search engines */}
      </ContentWrapper>
    </SectionContainer>
  )
}
```

5. **SEO Balance**: Optimize for search without compromising readability
6. **Narrative Flow**: Each section should advance the page story

8. **Conversion Focus**: Every section should guide toward goal
9. **Evidence-Based**: Back claims with data, testimonials, examples
10. **Continuous Improvement**: Test, measure, refine based on performance
