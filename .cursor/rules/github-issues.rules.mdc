## üìå Repository Info

- **Repo**: `saas-starter`

# Right Template

- For **feature requests**, use: [feature_request.md](mdc:.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md)
- For **bug reports**, use: [bug_report.md](mdc:.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
- Ensure the issue title and body match the tone and structure of the selected template

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan (Required)

- Every issue must include a **proposed implementation plan**
- Investigate the current codebase if necessary to:
  - Understand context and dependencies
  - Suggest viable and efficient implementation paths
- Be specific about:
  - Affected components or files
  - Expected changes (logic, UI, API, etc.)
  - Any blockers or unknowns

## ‚úÖ Best Practices

- Use **clear, concise language**
- Add **labels** (`bug`, `feature`, `enhancement`, etc.)
- Assign to the appropriate team member(s) if known
- Link to relevant commits, PRs, or documentation
