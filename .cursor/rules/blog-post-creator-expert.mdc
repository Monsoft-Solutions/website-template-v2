## Blog Post Creation Workflow

### Step 1: Topic Discovery & Proposal

**Process:**

1. **Check Brand Guidelines**: Read `docs/brand/brand-guidelines.md` to understand:
    - Target audience (small business owners, developers, etc.)
    - Brand voice
    - Messaging framework and content strategy

2. **Review Existing Posts**: Scan `packages/db/src/seed/posts/` to identify:
    - Topics already covered
    - Content gaps and opportunities

3. **Propose 3 Topics**: Present user with 3 relevant topic ideas:
    - **Topic 1**: Title, brief description, target audience benefit
    - **Topic 2**: Title, brief description, target audience benefit
    - **Topic 3**: Title, brief description, target audience benefit

   - Target: Business owners evaluating development options
   - Benefit: Demystifies technical decisions with clear comparisons

Which topic interests you, or would you like to suggest a different topic?
```

### Step 2: Create Blog Post Content

**Requirements:**

- Follow `docs/blog-writing-guidelines.md` for structure and style
- Apply brand voice from `docs/brand/brand-guidelines.md`
- Use SEO best practices from `seo-content-expert` agent knowledge
- Target 2,000-3,000 words for comprehensive coverage
- Include TL;DR, clear sections, actionable advice, conclusion

**Post Structure:**

```typescript
export const post: Omit<
    InsertBlogPost,
    'id' | 'authorId' | 'createdAt' | 'updatedAt'
> = {
    slug: 'unique-url-slug',
    title: 'SEO-Optimized Title (50-60 chars)',
    metaTitle: 'Meta Title for Search Results',
    metaDescription: 'Compelling 150-160 char description with primary keyword',
    metaKeywords: 'keyword1, keyword2, keyword3, keyword4',
    excerpt: 'Brief 100-150 char hook that makes readers want to click',
    content: `Full markdown content with TL;DR, sections, examples, conclusion`,
    readingTime: 8, // Approximate minutes based on word count
    status: 'published',
    publishedAt: new Date('2025-10-19T14:00:00Z'),
    isFeatured: true,
    allowComments: true,
}

export const categories = ['Category1', 'Category2']
export const tags = ['Tag1', 'Tag2', 'Tag3', 'Tag4']
```

**Content Guidelines:**

✅ **DO:**

- Write in brand voice
- Open with the problem/pain point
- Include specific, actionable advice
- Use examples and data points
- Add bullet points for scannability
- Write naturally (avoid AI clichés)
- Include internal links where relevant

❌ **DON'T:**

- Use corporate jargon or buzzwords
- Over-promise or use hype language
- Write generic "filler" content
- Forget to address the "why"
- Skip proofreading for flow

### Step 3: Create Featured Image

**Process:**

1. **Understand Image Context**: Analyze the blog post content to determine:
    - Main topic and theme
    - Target audience
    - Emotional tone (professional, friendly, technical, etc.)
    - Key visual elements that support the message

2. **Propose 3 Image Concepts**: Present user with 3 image ideas:

    ```
    Based on your blog post about [topic], here are 3 featured image concepts:

    1. **Concept 1**: [Description]
       - Style: [photorealistic, illustration, etc.]
       - Composition: [main elements, perspective]
       - Mood: [professional, warm, energetic, etc.]

    2. **Concept 2**: [Description]
       - Style: [...]
       - Composition: [...]
       - Mood: [...]

    3. **Concept 3**: [Description]
       - Style: [...]
       - Composition: [...]
       - Mood: [...]

    Which concept do you prefer, or would you like to suggest modifications?
    ```

3. **Ask for Model Selection**: Present recommended models:

    ```
    I can generate this image using several models. Which would you prefer?

    1. fal-ai/imagen4/preview/ultra - Highest quality (recommended for hero images)
    2. fal-ai/imagen4/preview - Excellent quality and balance
    3. fal-ai/imagen4/preview/fast - Speed-optimized photorealism (RECOMMENDED for blog posts)
    4. fal-ai/flux/schnell - Fast and cost-effective high-quality generation

    For blog post featured images, I recommend #3 (Imagen 4 Fast) for the best balance of quality and generation time.
    ```

4. **Craft Detailed Prompt**: Create prompt following image-creator-expert guidelines:
    - Start with primary subject
    - Add key details and context
    - Specify style and composition
    - Include lighting and mood
    - Add technical specifications
    - Target 16:9 aspect ratio (1392x752px)

**Example Prompt:**

```
Small business owner working on laptop in modern coffee shop, reviewing website analytics on screen, warm natural lighting from large windows, professional but approachable atmosphere, other customers softly blurred in background, shot with 35mm lens, shallow depth of field, contemporary lifestyle photography, photorealistic, high detail, 16:9 aspect ratio
```

### Step 4: Generate Image

**Process:**

1. **Get Model Schema**:

    ```typescript
    ;(await fal) - get - model - schema({ modelId: userSelectedModel })
    ```

2. **Enqueue Generation Request**:

    ```typescript
    const { request_id } =
        (await fal) -
        enqueue({
            modelId: userSelectedModel,
            input: {
                prompt: detailedPrompt,
                image_size: { width: 1392, height: 752 },
                num_images: 1,
            },
        })
    ```

3. **Monitor with Incremental Backoff**:
    - 1st check: Immediate
    - 2nd check: Wait 1 second
    - 3rd check: Wait 3 seconds
    - 4th check: Wait 5 seconds
    - 5th check: Wait 8 seconds
    - 6th+ checks: Wait 10 seconds (repeat)

4. **Retrieve Result**:
    ```typescript
    const result =
        (await fal) -
        get -
        result({
            modelId: userSelectedModel,
            requestId: request_id,
        })
    ```

### Step 5: Download & Upload to Vercel Blob

**Process:**

1. **Download Generated Image**:

    ```bash
    curl -o /path/to/public/images/posts/XX-post-slug.jpg "image-url"
    ```

2. **Upload to Vercel Blob**:

    ```typescript
    ;(await vercel) -
        blob -
        put -
        file({
            filePath: '/path/to/public/images/posts/XX-post-slug.jpg',
            pathname: 'posts/XX-post-slug.jpg',
            addRandomSuffix: false,
            cacheControlMaxAge: 31536000, // 1 year
        })
    ```

3. **Get Permanent URL**: Extract the Vercel Blob URL from response:
    ```
    https://[your-project].public.blob.vercel-storage.com/posts/XX-post-slug.jpg
    ```

### Step 6: Create Image Seed File

**Process:**

Create `packages/db/src/seed/posts/XX-post-slug.image.ts`:

```typescript
import type { InsertImage } from '../../schema/blog/image.table'

export const image: Omit<InsertImage, 'id' | 'createdAt' | 'updatedAt'> = {
    url: 'https://[vercel-blob-url]/posts/XX-post-slug.jpg',
    alt: 'Descriptive alt text for accessibility and SEO (100-125 chars)',
    title: 'Image Title',
    description: 'Detailed description of what the image shows (150-200 chars)',
    width: 1392,
    height: 752,
    fileSize: 123456, // bytes from upload response
    mimeType: 'image/jpeg',
    originalFilename: 'XX-post-slug.jpg',
}
```

**Critical Requirements:**

- Base filename must match post filename (e.g., `03-post.post.ts` → `03-post.image.ts`)
- Use Vercel Blob URL (permanent, not fal.ai temporary URL)
- Include descriptive alt text for SEO and accessibility
- File size from Vercel Blob upload response

### Step 7: Verify Seeding

**Process:**

1. **Run Seed Command**:

    ```bash
    pnpm --filter @workspace/db db:seed
    ```

2. **Check Console Output**:

    ```
    ✅ Inserted image: [Image Title]
    ✅ Inserted post: [Post Title]
    ✅ Database seeded successfully!
    ```

3. **Verify No Errors**: Check for linting errors or TypeScript issues

## File Naming Convention

**Critical Pattern**: `[number]-[slug].[type].ts`

- **Number**: Sequential (01, 02, 03, etc.)
- **Slug**: URL-friendly post slug (matches `post.slug` field)
- **Type**: Either `post` or `image`

**Examples:**

```
✅ CORRECT:
- 03-local-seo-for-small-businesses.post.ts
- 03-local-seo-for-small-businesses.image.ts

❌ WRONG:
- 03-local-seo.post.ts
- 04-different-name.image.ts  (numbers don't match)
- local-seo.post.ts            (missing number)
```

## Type Safety & Validation

**Post Type:**

```typescript
import type { InsertBlogPost } from '../../schema/blog/blog-post.table'

type PostExport = Omit<
    InsertBlogPost,
    'id' | 'authorId' | 'createdAt' | 'updatedAt'
>
```

**Image Type:**

```typescript
import type { InsertImage } from '../../schema/blog/image.table'

type ImageExport = Omit<InsertImage, 'id' | 'createdAt' | 'updatedAt'>
```

**Required Fields (Post):**

- slug, title, metaDescription, content, status, readingTime

**Required Fields (Image):**

- url, alt, width, height, fileSize, mimeType, originalFilename

## SEO Optimization Checklist

**Post SEO:**

- [ ] Unique, descriptive title (50-60 chars)
- [ ] Compelling meta description (150-160 chars)
- [ ] Primary keyword in title and first paragraph
- [ ] Secondary keywords in H2/H3 headings
- [ ] Natural keyword density (0.5-2%)
- [ ] Internal links to related content
- [ ] Clear heading hierarchy (H2 → H3)
- [ ] Scannable content with bullet points

**Image SEO:**

- [ ] Descriptive alt text with keywords
- [ ] Optimized file size (< 500KB)
- [ ] Appropriate dimensions (1392x752)
- [ ] Proper mime type (image/jpeg or image/png)
- [ ] Hosted on CDN (Vercel Blob)

## Quality Assurance

**Before Committing:**

- [ ] Post reads naturally when spoken aloud
- [ ] Content provides unique value (not generic)
- [ ] Brand voice is consistent (Keel guidelines)
- [ ] Image is relevant and professional
- [ ] Both files use matching base filenames
- [ ] Image uses Vercel Blob URL (not temporary fal.ai URL)
- [ ] TypeScript compiles without errors
- [ ] Seed command runs successfully
- [ ] No linting errors

## Common Pitfalls

**1. Mismatched Filenames**

```
❌ 03-local-seo.post.ts + 03-local-search.image.ts
✅ 03-local-seo.post.ts + 03-local-seo.image.ts
```

**2. Using Temporary Image URLs**

```
❌ url: 'https://v3b.fal.media/files/...'
✅ url: 'https://[project].public.blob.vercel-storage.com/posts/...'
```

**3. Skipping Image Upload**

```
❌ Create image seed → Run seed (FAILS: image not accessible)
✅ Generate → Download → Upload to Vercel Blob → Create seed with Vercel URL
```

**4. Generic Content**

```
❌ "We provide quality service..."
✅ "Here's how we solve [specific problem] for [specific audience]..."
```

## Complete Example

**Topic**: "Local SEO for Small Businesses"

**Files Created:**

1. `packages/db/src/seed/posts/03-local-seo-for-small-businesses.post.ts`
2. `packages/db/src/seed/posts/03-local-seo-for-small-businesses.image.ts`
3. `public/images/posts/03-local-seo-for-small-businesses.jpg` (local copy)

**Image**: Uploaded to Vercel Blob at permanent URL

**Result**: Blog post appears at `/blog/local-seo-for-small-businesses` with featured image
