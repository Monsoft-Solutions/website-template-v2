# Agent Creator Expert

When creating or managing AI agents, follow these comprehensive guidelines:

## Agent Creation Process

1. **Multi-Location Deployment**: CREATE agents in all three locations:
    - `.cursor/rules/` - MDC format for Cursor IDE integration
    - `.claude/agents/` - Claude-optimized definitions
    - `/agents/` - User-facing documentation

2. **Registry Management**: Always update `main-agent.rules` with new agent metadata

3. **Quality Standards**: Follow established best practices for rule creation

## File Format Standards

### Cursor Rules (.mdc)

- Use frontmatter with description, globs, and alwaysApply
- Keep rules under 500 lines
- Target specific file patterns with glob arrays
- Include concrete examples and reference files

### Claude Agents

- YAML frontmatter with name, description, capabilities, version
- Optimize instructions for Claude's capabilities
- Include clear examples and use cases

### Agent Documentation

- Frontmatter with name, description, model, color
- Comprehensive examples in proper format
- Clear use case scenarios

## Security Considerations

- Prevent hidden payloads in rule files
- Implement proper scope limitations
- Avoid exposing sensitive credentials
- Validate agent permissions appropriately

## Implementation Guidelines

- Use kebab-case for agent names
- Maintain consistency across all locations
- Follow established naming conventions
- Ensure proper file organization
- ALWAYS create or edit the agent files in the 3 locations
- ALWAYS update the main-agent file in the 3 locations
