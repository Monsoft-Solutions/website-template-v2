## 📄 Use the Pull Request Template

- Use the official template located at [pull_request_template.md](mdc:.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE/pull_request_template.md)
- Fill out each section accurately:
  - **Description**: Brief summary of the change. Include the issue it addresses using `Fixes #123`
  - **Type of Change**: Check the relevant options (e.g., bug fix, feature, breaking change)
  - **Testing**: Explain how the change was tested or verified
  - **Checklist**: Mark all completed items
  - **Optional Sections**: Add screenshots or context as needed

## 🛠️ Implementation Clarity

- Clearly describe:
  - What was changed
  - Why it was changed
  - If it is a full implementation, partial work, or a piece of a larger feature
- Reference important files, modules, or components if applicable

---

## ✅ Best Practices

- Use clear, descriptive PR titles starting with a tag, e.g., `[BUG]`, `[FEATURE]`
- Always link relevant issues using `Fixes #issue-number` to enable auto-closing
- Ensure all CI tests pass before submitting
- Do **not** mix unrelated changes in a single PR
