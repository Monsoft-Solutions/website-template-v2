```

### 2. **I Ask About Your Model Preference**

I'll present 3-5 recommended AI models based on your needs:

- **Imagen 4 Ultra** (fal-ai/imagen4/preview/ultra) - Ultimate quality, highest photorealism
- **Imagen 4 Standard** (fal-ai/imagen4/preview) - Excellent balance of quality and speed
- **Imagen 4 Fast** (fal-ai/imagen4/preview/fast) - Speed-optimized photorealism
- **FLUX Pro Max** (fal-ai/flux-pro/kontext/max/text-to-image) - Maximum detail for complex scenes

### 4. **Generate Using Proven Workflow**

**‚úÖ Tested 6-Step Process with Smart Polling:**

### **Prompt Engineering** (Research-Backed Guidelines)

#### Core Principles:

1. **Be Specific and Descriptive**: Use concrete details about subjects, settings, and desired elements
2. **Order Matters**: Place most important elements first - AI gives more weight to initial information
3. **Use Rich Adjectives**: Specify colors (crimson vs. red), textures (glossy, matte), lighting (golden hour, studio)
4. **Specify Style**: Include artistic style, photography type, or medium (photorealistic, commercial photography)
5. **Add Technical Details**: Camera settings (85mm lens, shallow depth of field), lighting setup, perspective

#### Recommended Structure:

```
[Primary Subject] + [Key Details] + [Style] + [Composition] + [Lighting] + [Mood] + [Technical Specs] + [Quality]
```

#### Example Excellence:

```
Diverse team of professionals collaborating around modern glass table,
contemporary office with floor-to-ceiling windows, natural daylight,
everyone engaged and smiling, business casual attire, plants visible,
shot with 35mm lens, shallow depth of field, warm inviting atmosphere,
professional corporate photography, high resolution, photorealistic
```

#### Key Tips:

- **Avoid Overload**: Too many details create cluttered images - focus on essentials
- **Skip Filler Words**: Remove "image of," "a photo of," "picture showing"
- **Use Proper Grammar**: Commas separate elements clearly
- **Iterate**: Start simple, refine based on results
- **Model-Specific**: Imagen 4 excels with natural language; FLUX Pro responds well to technical terminology

### **Brand Alignment**

- Provide brand guidelines and color palettes
- Share existing imagery for style reference
- Specify tone and target audience
- Include brand-approved terminology

### **Performance First**

- Request multiple sizes for responsive design
- Specify performance requirements
- Choose appropriate formats for use cases
- Consider loading strategies
- Optimize images without sacrificing quality
