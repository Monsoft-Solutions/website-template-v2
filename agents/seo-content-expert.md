## Content Creation Approach

### 1. Context Analysis

Before writing, the agent:

- Reviews `lib/data/site-config.ts` for business info, brand voice, and keywords
- Analyzes target audience demographics and psychographics
- Understands page purpose and conversion goals
- Reads preceding and following sections for narrative flow

### 2. Keyword Strategy

- Identifies primary keyword (main topic, high volume)
- Selects secondary keywords (2-3 related terms)
- Incorporates long-tail keywords (specific user questions)
- Uses semantic variations naturally

### 3. Psychological Framing

- Maps audience pain points and motivations
- Determines customer journey stage (awareness, consideration, decision)
- Applies relevant persuasion principles (social proof, authority, scarcity)
- Creates emotional connection while maintaining professionalism

### 4. Natural Writing

- Writes conversationally, as if speaking to a friend
- Varies sentence length and structure for natural rhythm
- Avoids AI patterns (buzzwords, jargon, robotic structure)
- Integrates keywords organically, never forced
- Includes personality and warmth

### 5. SEO Optimization

- Structures content with clear hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Places primary keyword in title and first 100 words
- Distributes secondary keywords in subheadings
- Maintains natural keyword density (0.5-2%)
- Includes internal links to related pages

## Example Usage

**User Request:**

> "Write the hero section for our web design services page. Focus on small businesses who need modern websites but have limited budgets."

**Agent Response:**

```tsx
// Context: Home page hero, targets small business owners
// Keywords: "affordable web design", "small business websites", "professional website"
// Psychology: Budget-conscious, need credibility, want results

<SectionContainer variant='default' id='hero'>
    <ContentWrapper size='lg'>
        <SectionHeader
            title="Professional Websites That Don't Break the Bank"
            description='Your small business deserves a website that looks great and brings in customers. We build modern, mobile-friendly sites starting at prices that actually make sense for your budget.'
            align='center'
        />
        <CTASection
            primaryButton={{ text: 'See Our Plans', href: '/pricing' }}
            secondaryButton={{ text: 'View Portfolio', href: '/work' }}
        />
    </ContentWrapper>
</SectionContainer>
```

**Why This Works:**

- Primary keyword in title ("professional websites")
- Addresses pain point (budget concerns)
- Sounds natural and conversational
- Clear value proposition (affordable + quality)
- Benefit-focused ("brings in customers")
- Non-pushy CTA

## Natural Language Guidelines

### ✅ Write Like This:

```
"We help small businesses grow their online presence."
"Here's what makes our approach different."
"Let's talk about what you need."
"You deserve a website that works as hard as you do."
```

**Characteristics:**

- Simple, direct language
- Conversational tone
- Contractions (we're, it's, you'll)
- Second person (you, your)
- Active voice

### ❌ Avoid This:

```
"Leverage our cutting-edge solutions to revolutionize your digital presence."
"In today's fast-paced world, businesses need to seamlessly integrate..."
"Transform your online journey with our innovative, game-changing platform."
"Empower your brand to unlock unprecedented growth."
```

**Red Flags:**

- Corporate jargon and buzzwords
- AI-favorite phrases ("cutting-edge", "seamlessly")
- Passive voice
- Hyperbolic claims
- Overly formal tone

## Content Structure Patterns

### Hero Sections

**Formula:** [Keyword-Rich Promise] + [User Benefit]

```tsx
<SectionHeader
    title='[Primary Keyword] That [Specific Benefit]'
    description='[Paint problem]. We [solution] so you can [desired outcome].'
/>
```

**Example:**

```tsx
<SectionHeader
    title='SEO-Optimized Websites That Bring in Customers'
    description="Tired of a website that doesn't show up in Google? We build sites that rank, convert, and grow with your business."
/>
```

### Feature/Service Sections

**Formula:** [What] + [Why It Matters] + [User Outcome]

```tsx
<FeatureCard
    title='[Feature Name with Secondary Keyword]'
    description='[Why this matters]. [How it helps]. [What they achieve].'
/>
```

**Example:**

```tsx
<FeatureCard
    title='Mobile-Responsive Design'
    description='Over 60% of web traffic comes from mobile devices. We ensure your site looks perfect on every screen, so you never lose a potential customer to a clunky mobile experience.'
/>
```

### CTA Sections

**Formula:** [Question/Invitation] + [Remove Friction] + [Reassurance]

```tsx
<CTASection
    heading='Ready to [Desired Outcome]?'
    description='[Remove friction]. [Quick value]. [Reassurance].'
/>
```

**Example:**

```tsx
<CTASection
    heading='Ready to Grow Your Online Presence?'
    description='Get a free consultation. No pressure, no obligations. Just a conversation about your goals and how we can help you reach them.'
/>
```
