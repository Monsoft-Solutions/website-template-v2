## Complete Workflow (7 Steps)

### Step 1: Topic Discovery & Proposal

1. Check `docs/brand/brand-guidelines.md` for audience and voice
2. Scan `packages/db/src/seed/posts/` for existing topics
3. Propose 3 relevant topic ideas with descriptions
4. User selects one or provides custom topic

### Step 2: Create Blog Post Content

1. Follow `docs/blog-writing-guidelines.md` structure
2. Apply brand voice
3. Write 2,000-3,000 words of SEO-optimized content
4. Include TL;DR, sections, examples, conclusion
5. Add categories and tags
6. Create `XX-slug.post.ts` file

**Post Structure:**

```typescript
export const post: Omit<
    InsertBlogPost,
    'id' | 'authorId' | 'createdAt' | 'updatedAt'
> = {
    slug: 'unique-slug',
    title: 'SEO-Optimized Title',
    metaTitle: 'Meta Title for Search',
    metaDescription: '150-160 char description',
    metaKeywords: 'keyword1, keyword2, keyword3',
    excerpt: 'Brief hook',
    content: `Full markdown content...`,
    readingTime: 8,
    status: 'published',
    publishedAt: new Date(),
    isFeatured: true,
    allowComments: true,
}

export const categories = ['Category1', 'Category2']
export const tags = ['Tag1', 'Tag2', 'Tag3']
```

### Step 3: Image Concept & Model Selection

1. Analyze post content for visual themes
2. Propose 3 image concepts (style, composition, mood)
3. Present 4-6 model options:
    - fal-ai/imagen4/preview/ultra (highest quality)
    - fal-ai/imagen4/preview (balanced)
    - fal-ai/imagen4/preview/fast (RECOMMENDED)
    - fal-ai/flux/schnell (fast & inexpensive)
4. Get user selection for concept and model

### Step 4: Generate Featured Image

1. **Get model schema**: `fal-get-model-schema`
2. **Enqueue generation**: `fal-enqueue` with detailed prompt
3. **Monitor with backoff**: Check status with delays (1s, 3s, 5s, 8s, 10s)
4. **Retrieve result**: `fal-get-result` when complete

**Prompt Guidelines:**

- Primary subject + key details
- Style and composition
- Lighting and mood
- Technical specs (16:9 aspect ratio)
- Quality modifiers (photorealistic, high detail)

### Step 5: Download Image

```bash
curl -o /path/to/public/images/posts/XX-slug.jpg "fal-image-url"
```

### Step 6: Upload to Vercel Blob

```typescript
;(await vercel) -
    blob -
    put -
    file({
        filePath: '/path/to/public/images/posts/XX-slug.jpg',
        pathname: 'posts/XX-slug.jpg',
        addRandomSuffix: false,
        cacheControlMaxAge: 31536000, // 1 year
    })

// Get permanent URL from response:
// https://[project].public.blob.vercel-storage.com/posts/XX-slug.jpg
```

### Step 7: Create Image Seed File

Create `XX-slug.image.ts` with Vercel Blob URL:

```typescript
import type { InsertImage } from '../../schema/blog/image.table'

export const image: Omit<InsertImage, 'id' | 'createdAt' | 'updatedAt'> = {
    url: 'https://[vercel-blob-url]/posts/XX-slug.jpg',
    alt: 'Descriptive alt text for SEO',
    title: 'Image Title',
    description: 'Detailed image description',
    width: 1392,
    height: 752,
    fileSize: 123456,
    mimeType: 'image/jpeg',
    originalFilename: 'XX-slug.jpg',
}
```

**Critical**: Base filename MUST match post filename

## File Naming Convention

Pattern: `[number]-[slug].[type].ts`

**Correct:**

```
03-local-seo-for-small-businesses.post.ts
03-local-seo-for-small-businesses.image.ts
```

**Wrong:**

```
03-local-seo.post.ts
04-different-name.image.ts  (numbers don't match)
```

## Quality Standards

**Content Quality:**

- [ ] 2,000-3,000 words
- [ ] Brand voice
- [ ] SEO-optimized (keywords, meta, structure)
- [ ] Actionable advice with examples
- [ ] Natural language (not AI-sounding)

**Image Quality:**

- [ ] Professional and relevant
- [ ] Proper dimensions (1392x752)
- [ ] Hosted on Vercel Blob (permanent URL)
- [ ] Descriptive alt text

**Technical Quality:**

- [ ] Matching base filenames
- [ ] Type-safe TypeScript
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Seed command runs successfully

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Mismatched Filenames**: Post and image must have same base filename
2. **Temporary URLs**: Must use Vercel Blob URL, not fal.ai URL
3. **Skipped Upload**: Must upload to Vercel Blob before creating seed
4. **Generic Content**: Must provide unique value, not filler

## Example Success

**Topic**: "Local SEO for Small Businesses"

**Files Created:**

- `03-local-seo-for-small-businesses.post.ts` (2,972 words)
- `03-local-seo-for-small-businesses.image.ts` (Vercel Blob URL)
- Image uploaded and accessible

**Result**:

```bash
pnpm --filter @workspace/db db:seed

✅ Inserted image: Local SEO for Small Business
✅ Inserted post: Local SEO for Small Businesses: How to Get More Customers Without Paid Ads
✅ Database seeded successfully!
```
