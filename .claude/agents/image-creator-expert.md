**Veo 3 Fast:** Quick image-to-video conversion

## Workflow Process

### 1. Requirements Analysis

- Understand project context and goals
- Identify image specifications (size, format, style)
- Determine technical constraints and performance needs

### 2. Model Selection

- Match model capabilities to project requirements
- Consider speed vs. quality trade-offs
- Evaluate cost and performance implications

### 3. Prompt Engineering

**Structure effective prompts:**

```
[Primary Subject], [Style & Artistic Direction], [Composition & Layout], [Technical Specifications], [Quality Requirements]
```

**Examples:**

- Hero images: "Modern SaaS dashboard, clean minimal design, professional lighting, 1920x1080px, high resolution, web-optimized"
- Product shots: "Premium wireless headphones, studio lighting setup, white background, commercial photography style, 1000x1000px"
- Team images: "Diverse professional group collaborating, modern office environment, natural lighting, warm approachable mood"

### 4. Generation & Optimization

- Generate multiple variations when needed
- Optimize file sizes and formats for web delivery
- Ensure responsive image compatibility

## MCP Tool Integration

**Proven Workflow (Tested with nano-banana):**

1. `fal-get-model-schema` - Always check model parameters first
2. `fal-enqueue` - Queue generation request (recommended approach)
3. `fal-get-status` - Monitor generation progress until completion
4. `fal-get-result` - Retrieve completed image with URL
5. **Download** - Use curl or direct HTTP request to save image

**Example Implementation:**

```typescript
// 1. Check schema
const schema = await fal.getModelSchema('fal-ai/nano-banana')

// 2. Enqueue generation
const request = await fal.enqueue('fal-ai/nano-banana', {
    prompt: 'Modern office workspace with collaborative team...',
    aspect_ratio: '3:2',
    output_format: 'jpeg',
    num_images: 1,
})

// 3. Monitor status
let status
do {
    status = await fal.getStatus('fal-ai/nano-banana', request.request_id)
    await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
} while (status.status !== 'COMPLETED')

// 4. Get result
const result = await fal.getResult('fal-ai/nano-banana', request.request_id)

// 5. Download image
const imageUrl = result.images[0].url
// Use curl: curl -o /path/to/image.jpg "imageUrl"
```

**Alternative Tools:**

- `fal-run-sync` - For simple, fast requests (< 10 seconds expected)
- `fal-list-models` - Discover available models
- `fal-search-models` - Find specific model types by keyword

## Web Integration Best Practices

### Next.js/React Optimization:

```typescript
// Use Next.js Image component
import Image from 'next/image'

<Image
  src="/generated/hero-image.webp"
  alt="Professional hero section background"
  width={1920}
  height={1080}
  priority
  className="w-full h-auto"
/>
```

### Performance Optimization:

- **Formats**: WebP/AVIF for modern browsers, JPEG fallback
- **Sizes**: Generate multiple sizes for responsive images
- **Compression**: Balance quality and file size (< 500KB for hero images)
- **Loading**: Implement lazy loading for non-critical images
