## Content Creation Workflow

// Review business info, audience, brand voice
```

**Step 2: Audience Research**

## Content Structure Patterns

### Hero Sections

```tsx
<SectionHeader
    title='[Primary Keyword] That [Specific Benefit]'
    description='[Problem]. We [solution] so you can [outcome].'
/>
```

### Feature Sections

```tsx
<FeatureCard
    title='[Feature with Secondary Keyword]'
    description='[Why it matters]. [How it helps]. [What they achieve].'
/>
```

### CTA Sections

```tsx
<CTASection
    heading='Ready to [Desired Outcome]?'
    description='[Remove friction]. [Value statement]. [Reassurance].'
/>
```

## Natural Language Guidelines

✅ **DO:**

- "We help businesses grow" (simple, direct)
- "Here's what you need to know" (conversational)
- Use contractions (it's, we're, you'll)
- Ask rhetorical questions
- Vary sentence length

❌ **AVOID:**

- "Leverage cutting-edge solutions" (corporate jargon)
- "In today's fast-paced world" (AI cliché)
- "Revolutionize, transform, empower" (overused buzzwords)
- "Seamlessly integrate" (AI favorite)
- Excessive exclamation marks

## Psychology-Driven Techniques

**Pain-Agitate-Solution (PAS):**

1. Identify specific pain point
2. Amplify problem impact
3. Present solution with proof

**Social Proof:**

- Customer testimonials with specific results
- Data points and statistics
- Industry recognition

**Authority Building:**

- Demonstrate expertise
- Share insights and original research
- Provide educational value

**Authentic Urgency:**

- Real scarcity (never fake)
- Time-sensitive benefits
- Opportunity cost focus

## SEO Technical Checklist

## Implementation Example

```tsx
import {
    ContentWrapper,
    SectionContainer,
    SectionHeader,
} from '@/components/shared'
import { siteConfig } from '@/lib/data/site-config'

export function SectionName() {
    // Context: Appears after [X], before [Y]
    // Goal: [Conversion/educational goal]
    // Keywords: [primary], [secondary]
    // Audience: [awareness stage]

    return (
        <SectionContainer variant='muted'>
            <ContentWrapper size='lg'>
                <SectionHeader
                    badge={siteConfig.seo.keywords[0]}
                    title='[Keyword-rich, benefit-focused heading]'
                    description='[Natural, conversational copy addressing user need]'
                />
                {/* Natural keyword integration */}
                {/* Clear value for user and search engines */}
            </ContentWrapper>
        </SectionContainer>
    )
}
```

## Key Reminders

1. **Context First**: Always check site-config.ts before writing
2. **Natural Language**: If it sounds forced, rewrite
3. **User Intent**: Solve problems, don't just rank
4. **Psychology**: Understand why users care
5. **SEO Balance**: Optimize without compromising readability
6. **Narrative Flow**: Advance the page story
7. **Authentic Voice**: Write like a human
8. **Conversion Focus**: Guide toward goal
9. **Evidence-Based**: Back claims with proof
10. **Test & Refine**: Measure performance
